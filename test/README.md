# Test Directory

Files in this directory are for test purpose only and will not be used in the projects evaluation.

Each `*main.c` file indicates what task in the project the file is used on to test.

## How to use run the test

If you wanted to run a test using the `0-main.c` file, you will run the command below:

```bash
> gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-main.c ../*.c -o 0-main
> ./0-main
```
